### We develop intelligent multi-robot systems
Our mission is to develop swarm technology that allows simple mini robots to perform complex tasks. We combine control theory, optimization, machine learning, and shape-changing and soft-robotic design to achieve collective intelligence within groups of robots.

### Using technology for a better world
Our swarm robots are developed with the purpose of solving environmental and socioeconomic challenges.
We aim to build reusable, reprogrammable, low-cost mini-robots capable of performing multiple tasks.
Our first product aims to address the Space Debris crisis in near-Earth space environment and facilitate future in-orbit missions.

### Our philosophy
Estigmergia is 100% owned by everyone in our team. We all bring our ideas to the table, make decisions on mutual consensus, and work hard to develop amazing technology.
We believe in full collaboration. We work better together, and the concept of collective intelligence is stated in our name and our research focus. Our business model and technology are based on a Decentralized Autonomous Operations.
